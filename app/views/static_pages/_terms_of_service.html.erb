Enforcement by assembleapp.org: If we are put on notice that your content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it is defamatory or violates privacy, intellectual property or publicity rights or others) or if we believe your content is inappropriate or objectionable, we may remove it from our platform, or we may make edits to bring your content into compliance. In the vast majority of cases, we will notify you and try to work with you to fix the issue before we take any of these actions (but we are not obligated to).
assembleapp.org has discretion in enforcing these Terms. We may terminate or suspend your permission to use our platform and services or disable your account at any time, and with or without notice, for any material or repeated violation of these Terms, your failure to pay any fees when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or for engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities.

The content you post remains yours, and you also allow us to reuse and share it: By submitting and posting content, you do not lose any ownership rights you may have in your content. However, you authorize us to share this content with anyone, distribute it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit (e.g. for clarity or optimization purposes). For example, we may shorten an event title for it to appear on our homepage or share the content with interested media. You also authorize us to allow others to do the same with your content.

If you share another user’s petitions and campaigns, you may not make any modifications, and you may not remove any attributions. When you post content to any third party service through the features and functionalities of our platform (such as our apps or API), you will be subject to the terms of that third party service. If you want to remove any petition or content from a third party service, you should contact that third party service and request removal directly from them.

<h3>Additional legal protections</h3>
<p>No waiver, assignment: If we waive any of our rights in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights generally or in the future. If we do not enforce all our rights all of the time under these Terms, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights, and we may decide to enforce them at a later date. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted under these Terms, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us to another company or person without restriction. We won’t be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform any obligation we have under these Terms if the delay or failure is due to events which are beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to any strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of approval or a license by a government agency.

No guarantee of service: We may decide to cease making available the assembleapp.org platform, apps or services or any portion of the services at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will assembleapp.org or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability.
Limitation of liability: To the fullest extent permitted under law, assembleapp.org and its affiliates, suppliers, partners and agents have no obligation or liability (whether arising in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise) for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages or liabilities (including, but not limited to, any loss of data or content, revenue or profit, or personal injury or death) arising from or related to your use of the assembleapp.org platform, service or any content provided by or through the assembleapp.org platform or service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages in advance.

If you are accepting these terms and policies and using the assembleapp.org services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.</p>
<h3>Dispute resolution</h3>
<p>assembleapp.org is a U.S.-based company and these Terms are governed by laws of the state of California and the United States of America, without regard to their conflict of law principles. If a court having proper authority decides that any portion of these terms, policies and guidelines is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply and the rest will still be in effect. The official language of these Terms is English. If there is a conflict between the English language version and any translation, the English language version will prevail.
In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to these Terms or an alleged breach thereof, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, between you and us, we shall use our respective best efforts to settle the dispute. If a dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled “Notice of Dispute,” specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute. Please contact us at <a href='mailto:technology.activism.foundation@gmail.com'>technology.activism.foundation@gmail.com</a> to request a mailing address.
Following assembleapp.org’s receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the dispute that is satisfactory to both parties. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the dispute through this dispute resolution mechanism within 90 days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then any subsequent claim, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the assembleapp.org services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
